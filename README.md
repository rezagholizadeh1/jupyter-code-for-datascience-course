In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

list_of_datascience_languages = sorted(["Python", "R", "Java"])
print(list_of_datascience_languages)
['Java', 'Python', 'R']
Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
 #This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
17
hours
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
print(f"200 minutes is {200 / 60} hours")
200 minutes is 3.3333333333333335 hours
